# DFS ALGORITHM 


## ALGORITHM 


1 Here , we  find all the neighbors of a given node 

2 Recursively call the dfs for all the neighbors , and also keep track of visited node 

3 Here, depth wise , order is maintained . Here , we complete a path depth wise , and the return to find all the other subsequent paths 


Time Complexity : O(V+E)
