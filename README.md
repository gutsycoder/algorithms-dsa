This repository is aimed for containing all  the important algorithms that are used in DSA .

For contributing in the repository, the code structure would be as follows :-

>Topic Name 
   >Source code of algorithm (preferably in python)
   >Algorithm in .md format , explaining the various steps .
   >If Algorithm needs image explanation , images can also be attached for better explanation 


Note :- If a topic folder is already created , don't create a new folder with or if a algorithm is already written , try to optimize or try to increase the code readbility in it or try to improve the algorithm definition
