Sure, I'll explain the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the example typically demonstrated on GeeksforGeeks for dynamic programming.

## Example: Dynamic Programming Approach

### Problem Setup

Given 4 cities (0, 1, 2, 3) with the following distance matrix:

|     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | 0 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
| **1** | 10 | 0 | 35 | 25 |
| **2** | 15 | 35 | 0 | 30 |
| **3** | 20 | 25 | 30 | 0 |

### Goal
Find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

1. **Sub-problems**:
   Define a sub-problem as the shortest path starting at city 0, visiting a subset of cities, and ending at city \( i \).

2. **State Representation**:
   Use a bitmask to represent subsets of cities and a 2D array `dp[mask][i]` to store the shortest path to reach city \( i \) with the visited cities denoted by `mask`.

3. **Initialization**:
   Start with only the starting city visited:
   \[ dp[1][0] = 0 \]
   Other entries initialized to infinity.

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
   For each subset of cities `mask` and each city \( j \) in the subset:
   \[ dp[mask][j] = \min(dp[mask][j], dp[prev\_mask][i] + dist[i][j]) \]
   where `prev_mask` is the subset without city \( j \), and \( i \) is any city in `prev_mask`.

5. **Final Solution**:
   The shortest tour covering all cities and returning to the start city 0:
   \[ \text{Result} = \min(dp[2^n-1][i] + dist[i][0]) \]
   for all cities \( i \).

### Example Execution

1. Initialize:
   \[ dp[1][0] = 0 \]
   \[ dp[1][1], dp[1][2], dp[1][3] = \infty \]

2. Fill the DP table by iterating over subsets and cities.

3. The final DP table gives the shortest path for each subset of cities ending at each city.

4. Extract the minimum cost tour from the DP table.

### Result
The shortest path calculated using dynamic programming for the given example is usually found to be 80 units, covering the route 0 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 0.
