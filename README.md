# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains important algorithms used in DSA.

## Contributing Guidelines

For contributing to the repository, follow this structure:

* **Topic Name**
   * Source code of the algorithm (preferably in Python)
   * Algorithm in .md format, explaining the various steps.
   * If the algorithm needs image explanation, images can also be attached for better understanding.

### Note:

- If a topic folder is already created, don't create a new folder.
- If an algorithm is already written, try to optimize it or improve code readability and the algorithm's definition.
